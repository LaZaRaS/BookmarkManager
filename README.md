# BookmarkManager

This project is a simple yet realistic backend service designed to showcase modern DevOps and backend engineering practices. It implements a fully containerized FastAPI REST API for managing personal bookmarks with tagging and search capabilities, backed by a MySQL database, and deployed end-to-end using Ansible automation.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical experience with:

* Containerization (Docker, multi-stage builds, docker compose)

* Infrastructure automation (Ansible roles & playbooks)
